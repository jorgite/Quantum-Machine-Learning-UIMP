EXERCISE UNIT 1

(must be send before 27/11/2025 at 10.00 via the virtual campus)

Solve a problem about probability distributions, error bars and confidence intervals using Python Notebooks. 
Study the background theoretical material on probability theory and concentration inequalities in UD 1.7. 

PROBLEM 0
Create a script that generates random data from different distributions. Compare: (a) a normal or Gaussian distribution for different values of the variance and mean, (b) a uniformly random distribution, (c) the beta distribution.

PROBLEM 1
Estimate and compare the confidence intervals or error bars obtained for each distribution using Hoeffding's inequality and the Chebyshev inequality (for the latter one, you need to analyze or empirically estimate the variance).

PROBLEM 2
When possible, compare your results to theoretical values.

PROBLEM 3
For which distributions does the 68–95–99.7 rule hold? Provide answers via Jupyter notebooks in GitHub or similar hosting server.

0. First: install the required packages to run the quantum lineary systems algorithm tutorial file.
Then: Run the Jupyter notebook "hhl_tutorial.ipnb". Make sure it runs without errors. 
Complete the exercises in the Jupyter tutorial and submit your GitHub repository back to the instructor.
1. Set `num_state_qubits` to be the qubit number $n$. In this case, the fucntion will output $2^n \times 2^n$ matrix. Perform simulations for qubit numbers $n\leq 5$. Answer: what is the maximum number of qubits $M$ that you can simulate in your machine? State the model of the processor that you have in your PC and, if available, the graphics card or GPU.
2. Use the Qiskit HHL class documented in the Jupyter notebook ''hhl_tutorial.ipynb''  to provide explicit quantum circuits that prepare a quantum solution of the linear system. To this end, you can use the `state` property of the `LinearSolverResult` object returned by `HHL.solve()` in the Jupyter notebook and the `print` command. 
3. Use the HHL quantum algorithm to estimate properties for the HHL solutions to different systems of equations. To this end, choose a system $Ax=b$ defined by a triadiagonal matrix $A$ that you can solve using HHL with at most $M\leq 5$ qubits. Generate with the `TridiagonalToeplitz` class `class TridiagonalToeplitz(num_state_qubits, main_diag, off_diag, tolerance=0.01, evolution_time=1.0, trotter_steps=1, name='tridi')`. Solve the system for your chosen matrix and report the following properties for the solutions: 
(a) The vector norm $\|\mathbf{x}\|$ of a solution vector (use the `euclidean_norm` property). (b) The average of the vector entries. (c) The inner product $\langle x B x \rangle$ where $B$ is a Hermitian observable of your choice. (d) Verify your solutions using the classical Numpy solver `linalg`, `LinearSolverResult` to verify your solutions.
4. Study the influence of the performance with the size of the matrix entries for Triagonal matrices. Use different ranges for the matrix entries: (a) $a,b$ are randomly chosen real numbers in the interval $[-1,1]$. (b) $a,b$ are randomly chosen $\log(n)$-digit numbers in the interval $[-n,n]$. (c) $a,b$ are randomly chosen $n$-digit numbers in $[-2^n, 2^n]$. What is the influence of the size of the range in the cost of running HHL?
5. Be careful with the complexity of the exact HHL method vs the approximate HHL method. The naive default implementation of HHL the efficient implementation of the Qiskit library commits no errorr but can take more time to run. 
6. You can use the TridiagonalToeplitz function, which implements the Hamiltonian simulation algorihtm for larger tridiagonal matrices. Estimate the complexity for larger qubits sizes only for the approximate efficient method.
