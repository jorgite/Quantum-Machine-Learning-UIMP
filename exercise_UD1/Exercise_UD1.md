EXERCISE UNIT 1

(must be send before 27/11/2025 at 10.00 via the virtual campus, providint the link to the repository)
Solve problems about probability distributions, error bars and confidence intervals using Python Notebooks. 
Study the background theoretical material on probability theory and concentration inequalities. 

PROBLEM 0
Create a script that generates random data from different distributions. Compare: (a) a normal or Gaussian distribution for different values of the variance and mean, (b) a uniformly random distribution, (c) the beta distribution.
The problem is to solve wheter the approx of taking the 'empirical' mean as the 'real' mean is good or not

PROBLEM 1
Estimate and compare the confidence intervals or error bars obtained for each distribution using Hoeffding's inequality and the Chebyshev inequality (for the latter one, you need to analyze or empirically estimate the variance).

PROBLEM 2
When possible, compare your results to theoretical values.
In fact is double crossing our resoult of P1

PROBLEM 3
For which distributions does the 68–95–99.7 rule hold?
It's similar to P1 but with other rule
