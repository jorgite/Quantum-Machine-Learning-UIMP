Here I'll put all the things I must do in order to get the exercise done

Review video of the class (1h20min-1h40min)

Repasar las deducciones de andreu para chebysheb i hoeff (como llegar a las expressiones finales de los intervalos de confianza)

P1
    Review if I think the explanation of the inequalities is well done
    Define in P0 the different distributions I would like to use in the other problems and save them in different variables
    Compute for each distribution the bounds needed for the hoeff ineq
    Compute the inequalities and think how to represent them (plot, table...)
    give some comments of the results obtained

P2
    find some theoretical info to compare with
    do the comparison and give some comments on the results of P1 

P3 
    do it
