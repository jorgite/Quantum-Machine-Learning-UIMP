Review video of the class (1h20min-1h40min)

Repasar las deducciones de andreu para chebysheb i hoeff (como llega a las expressiones finales de los intervalos de confianza)

P1
    give some comments of the results obtained
        compare the efect of n (and therefore the central limit theorem...)
        do also something similar considering 
            another gaussian with diferent variance (the mean has no effect I think)
            another uniform with different value of d=b-a (i think the concrete values do not matter)
            another beta with different alpha and beta (i'm not sure the meaning of them so i can't make predictions for this one)
    try to represent them better (plot? table?)
    it'd be interesting to study and understanding the scalability of the parameters (video of the class, 1h25min aprox)
    
P2
    find some theoretical info to compare with (search + chatgpt)
    do the comparison and give some comments on the results of P1 

P3 
    do it
