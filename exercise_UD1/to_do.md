Here I'll put all the things I must do in order to get the exercise done

1. Try the tutorials (the general ones of github, python, linear solvers...), here is the extended version of them:
    https://github.com/Qiskit/textbook
    https://github.com/tybens/quantum-data-fitting-HHL
2. point 6 of the readme and do the tutorials on the topic of the exercise
    Tutorial 1. Probability and optimization: https://github.com/taldatech/ee046202-unsupervised-learning-data-analysis/blob/master/ee046202_tutorial_00_probability_optimization.ipynb
    Tutorial 2. Point Estimation: https://github.com/taldatech/ee046202-unsupervised-learning-data-analysis/blob/master/ee046202_tutorial_01_classic_statistics_point_estimation.ipynb
    Tutorial 3. Confidence intervals, error bounds: https://github.com/taldatech/ee046202-unsupervised-learning-data-analysis/blob/master/ee046202_tutorial_02_classic_statistics_confidence_intervals.ipynb
3. Problem 0
4. Problem 1
5. Problem 2
6. Problem 3
7. Extend with some extra materials:
