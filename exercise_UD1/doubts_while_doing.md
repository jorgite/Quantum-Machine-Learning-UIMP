1. The distributions we are doing are continuous or discrete? see Uniform in the case of a=0 b=1 to understand why i'm worried
2. I think the plot of the Andreu's cdf are not well (sometimes the cdf < pdf and it makes no sense) 
3. The beta distribution is not normalized??!?!?!??!!?
4. maybe in problem 0 is needed more word type comparation
