Some ideas of other master students:
    --> For Hoeffding and Chebyshev and for each distribution I have plotted the confidence interval Epsilon vs the probability P of being inside that range (with P from 0 to 1). So 2 curves per distribution.
    --> I just presented the values and then I have estimated how many times the mean is in the intervals estimated
    --> The plot i have done is to compare the width between intervals estimated with chebyshev and hoeffding

Hoeffding inequalities / bounds
    --> the smallest the interval for each variable, the better (it will provide a narrower interval for the mean given level of confidence)
    --> it's always useful but not always very tight

Chebishev inequalities / bounds
    --> works well (better than Hoeffding) if the variance is know and small
    --> in fact, it gives an interval of confidence for EACH variable (refered to the real mean)
    --> if we want a 95% confidence, then we have to get the epsilon to get that confidence and that defines our error bar

68-95-99.7
    --> A weaker three-sigma rule can be derived from Chebyshev's inequality, stating that even for non-normally distributed variables, at least 88.8% of cases should fall within properly calculated three-sigma intervals.

SOME DOUBTS WHILE DOING THE EXERCISE

PROBLEM 0

1. The distributions we are doing are continuous or discrete? see Uniform in the case of a=0 b=1 to understand why i'm worried
2. The beta distribution is not normalized??!?!?!??!!?
3. maybe in problem 0 is needed more word type comparation

PROBLEM 1-3
